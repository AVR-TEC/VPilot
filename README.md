Steering, Throttle and Brake regressor from raw camera pixels for self-driving cars, trained with DeepGTAV

This project will use [DeepGTAV](https://github.com/ai-tor/DeepGTAV) to train a self-driving car from camera pixels in both a supervised and a reinforcement learning fashion.

It is still under development and for now it works as a demonstration on how to communicate with DeepGTAV in Reinforcement Learning mode to control the vehicle with Python 3. It runs a Keras model in top of Tensorflow.
